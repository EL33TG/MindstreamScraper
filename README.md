# WebScraper
 
This is a basic websscraper that checks for certain HTTP codes and displays/returns the results.
An option for exporting the results have been added but MS Excel would have to be installed for this to work.
A revision the the Excel file needed will be included in later updates when I move the code over to a .NET MVC application.
